            <h2>Stroke</h2>
            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p>What is a stroke - A stroke occurs when there is a sudden disruption in the blood supply to the brain, leading to damage or death of brain cells this can result 
                and various physical and cognitive impairments</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Causes of it</h4>
            <p>
                A stroke happens when blood flow to your brain is stopped. 
                It is an emergency situation. It can be caused by a narrowed blood vessel, bleeding, or a clot that blocks blood flow

            <h4>Types of stroke:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ischemic strokes. These are strokes caused by blockage of an artery (or, in rare instances, a vein). About 87% of all strokes are ischemic.
<li>Hemorrhagic stroke. These are strokes caused by bleeding. About 13% of all strokes are hemorrhagic.
</ul>

            <h4>How to lower the risk</h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you smoke, quit.
                    <li>Keep your blood sugar (glucose) in the normal range.
                    <li>If you have heart disease, get treatment.
                    <li>Keep your cholesterol levels in the normal range.
                       
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Treatment for it</h4>
            <p>><ul>
                <li>The main treatment for an ischemic stroke is a medicine called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). It breaks up the blood clots that block blood flow to your brain.
                <li>High blood pressure is the most common cause of hemorrhagic strokes, a top priority for treating these strokes is lowering your blood pressure and keeping it at a safe level. 
                Doing this can reduce the amount of bleeding in your brain. It also makes it easier for blood to clot and seal the damaged blood vessel.
